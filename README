js0n - the "cheapest" c json parser possible?

A one-pass super low overhead parsing walk of the raw bytes and no mem copying of any sort, fills in a simple array of offsets and lengths of the first depth array values or object key/values. It should parse any valid json, but trades full validation for efficiency (some invalid json will still parse).  Excellent for low level high speed scanning/routing of small chunks of json.

Parsing this:

{"foo":"bar","barbar":[1,2,3],"obj":{"a":"b"}}

Would result in:

2,3,8,3,14,6,22,7,30,3,35,9,0

Also includes a collection utility functions for handy ways of using js0n quickly/easily.
